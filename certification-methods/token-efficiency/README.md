# HAAN Certification - Token Efficiency Metric

## Introduction

This document describes the methodology used to evaluate **Token Efficiency**, one of the critical metrics of the **HAAN (Human-AI Agentic Network)** Certification.

The Token Efficiency metric measures how compact, meaningful, and logically dense an AI or human-generated output is, without loss of essential information or degradation of coherence.

## Methodology

### Step 1: Analyze Prompt Complexity
- Classify the input prompt as **Simple**, **Moderate**, or **Complex**.

### Step 2: Define Ideal Output Profile
- Set a target:
  - **Length** (expected token count range),
  - **Information Density** (high, medium, low),
  - **Structure** (format expectations like list, paragraph, technical structure, etc.).

### Step 3: Calculate Actual Output Tokens
- Use a tokenizer (e.g., [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken)) to determine the actual number of tokens in the output.

### Step 4: Redundancy Detection (Semantic Level)
- Detect repeated ideas, not just duplicate words.
- Use semantic comparison methods if available.

### Step 5: Information Density Measurement
- Calculate the **Distinct Information Units per Token** ratio:
  - Higher ratio = better density.

### Step 6: Compression Resistance Test
- Compress the output using algorithms like:
  - DEFLATE
  - Brotli
  - LZ77
- Denser, higher-quality outputs resist compression better.

### Step 7: Entropy Analysis
- Perform a **Shannon Entropy Analysis** on token distribution.
- Look for a healthy balance between predictability and randomness.

### Step 8: Deviation Scoring
- Compare actual performance against the defined Ideal Output Profile.
- Calculate deviation percentage.

### Step 9: Contextual Adjustments
- Adjust evaluation based on:
  - Type of task (creative, technical, instructional),
  - Industry requirements,
  - Audience sophistication.

### Step 10: Plausibility Check
- Verify that meaning and logical sense are preserved even under compression or density optimization.

### Step 11: Audience Sensitivity Analysis
- Adapt expectations based on the audience:
  - Technical readers, general users, executives, students, etc.

### Step 12: Adaptive Threshold Learning
- Fine-tune the scoring thresholds based on cumulative past evaluations and benchmarks.

## Scoring Thresholds

| Deviation from Ideal | Score |
|:----------------------|:------|
| Within ±15% of expected | 90–100% (Platinum) |
| Within ±30% of expected | 80–89% (Gold) |
| More than ±30% deviation | Fail |

> **Note:**  
> The Token Efficiency Metric alone does **not** grant HAAN Certification.  
> All evaluated metrics must meet or exceed the 80% threshold individually for a full HAAN Certification.

## Underlying Principles

| Principle | Role |
|:-----------|:-----|
| Redundancy Elimination | Improve compactness without losing meaning |
| Semantic Overlap Detection | Remove ideas that are semantically redundant |
| Information Theory (Entropy) | Quantify meaningful randomness and information density |
| Compression Proofing | Validate density through resistance to compression algorithms |
| Dynamic Baselines | Avoid rigid, universal thresholds — adapt to context |
| Context Sensitivity | Understand target audience and specific use case |
| Threshold Adaptivity | Continual improvement based on cumulative learning |
| Plausibility and Logic Testing | Ensure the output still makes logical and semantic sense |

## Reminder

- "Ad astra per aspera" — through hardships to the stars.
- HAAN Certification demands excellence across **all metrics**, not just one.
