# Token Efficiency - Example Analysis

## Objective

Demonstrate how to analyze a sample prompt and output based on the "Token Efficiency" metric of the HAAN Certification.

## Example

### Sample Prompt:
> "Summarize the key advancements in renewable energy over the past decade."

### Ideal Output Profile:
- **Length Target:** 150–200 tokens
- **Information Density:** High (succinctly covering multiple innovations across solar, wind, and battery storage)
- **Structure:** Organized summary (preferably bullet points or categorized themes)

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Analyze Prompt Complexity:**  
   - Classified as *Moderate* (requiring moderate synthesis).

2. **Define Ideal Output Profile:**  
   - As above (Length, Density, Structure defined).

3. **Calculate Actual Output Tokens:**  
   - Output has **192 tokens**.

4. **Redundancy Detection (Semantic Level):**  
   - No significant semantic overlaps detected.

5. **Information Density Measurement:**  
   - 22 distinct innovation points / 192 tokens = 1 point every ~8.7 tokens (High Density).

6. **Compression Resistance Test:**  
   - DEFLATE Compression only achieved 8% reduction → indicates high inherent density.

7. **Entropy Analysis:**  
   - Shannon entropy measured at 4.75 bits per token (Healthy complexity).

8. **Deviation Scoring:**  
   - Within ±10% of Ideal Profile = **Platinum Range**.

9. **Contextual Adjustments:**  
   - Target audience (policy makers) requires concise yet moderately technical output → good alignment.

10. **Plausibility Check:**  
    - Logical and complete connections between all innovation points.

11. **Audience Sensitivity Analysis:**  
    - Density well-adapted to policymakers’ expected reading sophistication.

12. **Adaptive Threshold Learning:**  
    - Confirmed — previous 10 tests similar range; no major recalibration needed.

13. **Final Metric Result:**
   - **Token Efficiency: Platinum Level (90-100% Match to Ideal)**
